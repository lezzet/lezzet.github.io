						<!--one question-->
						<p><strong>Where are the böreks made?</strong></p>
						<p>

							All Lezzet Börek's are made in a private kitchen in New Jersey by a Turkish family. 
							We handmake all our böreks, including the yufka and phyllo dough, with organic ingredients.  
 
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<!--end question-->
						
						<!--one question-->
						<p><strong>What does Lezzet mean?</strong></p>
						<p>

							Lezzet, our company name, means "delicious taste" in Turkish. The name reflects our product very well! We are
							sure you will fall head over heals for our delicious böreks.
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<!--end question-->
						
						<!--one question-->
						<p><strong>Why should I buy böreks?</strong></p>
						<p>

							There are so many reasons! First off, if you've never tried one before, you must try it at least once! It 
							is a dish common in many parts of the world and is an excellent way to immerse yourself to different cultures and
							expand your palette. Second of all, they are filling! The beauty of the börek is how versatile it is: you can have it 
							as a late-night snack or a meal. Either way, theres no need to feel guilty because it is a healthy treat.
 
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<!--end question-->
						
						<!--one question-->
						<p><strong>Can I sell böreks in my store or buy them wholesale?</strong></p>
						<p>

							ABSOLUTELY! Ordering 14 makes a typical tray of böreks. Feel free to order
							<a href="../shop/index.html">on our online store</a> or email us at <a href="mailto:wholesale@lezzetboreks.com">
							wholesale@lezzetboreks.com</a> with your business information and we'll certainly guide you through the
							best option for you!
 
						</p>
						<p>&nbsp;</p>
						<!--end question-->
						
						<!--one question-->
						<p><strong>How can I make a bigger order for a party or special event?</strong></p>
						<p>

							We provide the option to buy our böreks in trays
							<a href="../shop/index.html">on our online store</a>. If you would like to curate a specific order and need guidance,
							feel free to email us at <a href="mailto:info@lezzetboreks.com">
